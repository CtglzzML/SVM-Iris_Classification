# SVM Iris Classification

This project demonstrates how to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the Iris dataset.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset included in scikit-learn. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, divided into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## Objective

To train a linear SVM model to classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.

## Output

The script splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains a linear SVM classifier, and evaluates the accuracy on both sets.
